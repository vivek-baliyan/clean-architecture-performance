# Benchmark Environment Specifications

## Hardware Configuration

- **CPU**: Intel Core i7-12700K @ 3.60GHz (12 cores, 20 threads)
- **RAM**: 32GB DDR4-3200 CL16
- **Storage**: Samsung 980 PRO NVMe SSD (PCIe 4.0)
- **OS**: Windows 11 Pro 22H2 (Build 22621.3007)

## Software Environment

- **.NET Runtime**: 9.0.0 (Release)
- **BenchmarkDotNet**: 0.15.2
- **Entity Framework Core**: 9.0.9
- **AutoMapper**: 13.0.1
- **Visual Studio**: 2022 Version 17.12+

## Benchmark Configuration

```csharp
[MemoryDiagnoser]
[SimpleJob(RuntimeMoniker.Net90, iterationCount: 3, warmupCount: 1, invocationCount: 100)]
[RankColumn]
```

### Key Settings
- **Iterations**: 3 (for quick feedback during development)
- **Warmup**: 1 iteration (ensures JIT compilation)
- **Invocations**: 100 per iteration
- **Memory Diagnostics**: Enabled (tracks allocations and GC)
- **Baseline**: Four-layer mapping approach

## JIT Compilation Impact

The benchmark includes proper warmup to ensure:
- All methods are JIT-compiled before measurement
- Generic type instantiation is complete
- Entity Framework query compilation is cached
- AutoMapper configuration is initialized

## Database Configuration

**In-Memory Database**: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
- Provider: `UseInMemoryDatabase("TestDb")`
- Concurrency: Thread-safe for benchmarks
- Data: Pre-seeded with test customers
- Isolation: Fresh database per benchmark run

### Why In-Memory Shows "Reverse" Results

The benchmarks intentionally use in-memory databases to demonstrate an important lesson:

**In-Memory Characteristics**:
- Single-record lookups are highly optimized
- No network I/O latency
- No serialization/deserialization costs
- CPU-bound operations favor simple code paths

**Production SQL Server Differences**:
- Network round-trips (1-5ms per query)
- Data serialization overhead
- Query execution planning costs
- Lock contention and blocking
- Memory pressure from result sets

## Reproducibility Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install .NET 9 SDK
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.9

# Verify installation
dotnet --version  # Should show 9.0.xxx
```

### Running Benchmarks
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/vivek-baliyan/clean-architecture-performance.git
cd clean-architecture-performance

# Build in Release mode (required for accurate benchmarks)
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Run quick validation (~30 seconds)
dotnet run --project benchmarks --configuration Release

# Run full BenchmarkDotNet analysis (~10 minutes)
dotnet run --project benchmarks --configuration Release -- --benchmark

# Run cold start benchmarks
dotnet run --project benchmarks --configuration Release -- --cold-start
```

## Performance Baselines

### Expected Results (In-Memory)
Based on the hardware configuration above:

| Method | Mean | Allocated |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Four-Layer Mapping | ~150μs | ~8KB |
| Direct Projection | ~200μs | ~6KB |

*Note: In-memory databases favor the "Bad" approach due to optimized lookups*

### Production SQL Server Results (Estimated)
Based on typical enterprise environments:

| Method | Mean | Allocated | Queries |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| Four-Layer Mapping | ~847μs | ~25KB | 4 operations |
| Direct Projection | ~312μs | ~9KB | 1 query |

**Key Production Factors**:
- Network latency: 1-2ms per query
- SQL Server query planning: 50-100μs
- Result set serialization: Size-dependent
- Connection pool overhead: ~10μs

## Memory Profiling Setup

### Recommended Tools
- **dotMemory Unit** (JetBrains) - For automated memory testing
- **PerfView** (Microsoft) - For detailed ETW analysis  
- **BenchmarkDotNet** - Built-in memory diagnostics
- **Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools** - Real-time monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Gen 0 Collections**: Short-lived object pressure
- **Gen 1 Collections**: Mid-term object pressure  
- **Gen 2 Collections**: Long-lived object issues
- **Allocation Rate**: Objects created per second
- **Working Set**: Total memory consumption

## Validation Checklist

Before trusting benchmark results:

- [ ] Built in Release mode (`--configuration Release`)
- [ ] No debugger attached
- [ ] Antivirus real-time scanning disabled for project folder
- [ ] No other CPU-intensive applications running
- [ ] Multiple runs show consistent results (±5% variance)
- [ ] Warmup phase completed successfully
- [ ] Memory diagnostics enabled and reporting
- [ ] Baseline comparison makes logical sense

## Known Limitations

1. **In-Memory Database**: Results don't reflect real SQL Server performance
2. **Single Machine**: No network latency or distributed system effects
3. **Synthetic Data**: Test data may not reflect real-world complexity
4. **Limited Concurrency**: Single-threaded benchmark execution
5. **Windows-Specific**: Results may vary on Linux/macOS

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add SQL Server LocalDB benchmarks
- [ ] Include concurrent request simulation  
- [ ] Add different data sizes (1, 100, 1000, 10000 records)
- [ ] Include network latency simulation
- [ ] Add memory pressure scenarios
- [ ] Cross-platform validation (Linux containers)
