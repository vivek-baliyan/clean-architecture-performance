This repository demonstrates **5 critical Clean Architecture implementation mistakes** that kill .NET performance, with proven fixes and benchmarks.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Benchmarks for Mistake #3 (Too Many Layers) use in-memory databases and currently show **reverse performance** (Good appears slower). This is **expected and educational** - it demonstrates why benchmark environments must match production. 
> 
> **Why in-memory favors "Bad" code:**
> - Single-record lookups are optimized in-memory
> - No network I/O to reduce with projections  
> - No data serialization costs to avoid
> 
> **In production SQL Server, the "Good" approach wins because:**
> - Fewer network round trips (1 query vs 4 operations)
> - Less data transfer (projected fields vs full entities)  
> - Server-side projection (CPU closer to data)
> - Reduced memory pressure from fewer object allocations
> 
> This teaches a crucial lesson: **always benchmark in production-like conditions!**

## 🎯 Performance Impact

| Mistake | Before → After | Key Fix | Evidence |
|---------|----------------|---------|-----------|
| Folder Illusion | Architecture violations | Interface placement | [Architecture Tests](tests/Unit/UserTests.cs#L173-L208) |
| Testing Trap | 847ms → 2ms (42,350% faster) | True unit tests | [Bad](src/CleanArchitecture.Examples/Mistake2_TestingTrap/Bad/) vs [Good](src/CleanArchitecture.Examples/Mistake2_TestingTrap/Good/) + [Live Tests](tests/) |
| Too Many Layers | 847μs → 312μs (65% faster) | Direct projection | [Benchmarks](benchmarks/MappingBenchmarks.cs) |
| Cargo Cult | 3.5hr → 5min delivery | Pragmatic design | [Bad](src/CleanArchitecture.Examples/Mistake4_CargoCult/Bad/) vs [Good](src/CleanArchitecture.Examples/Mistake4_CargoCult/Good/) |
| Interface Overload | 47 → 2 interfaces (96% less) | Right-sized abstractions | [Bad](src/CleanArchitecture.Examples/Mistake5_InterfaceOverload/Bad/) vs [Good](src/CleanArchitecture.Examples/Mistake5_InterfaceOverload/Good/) |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **.NET 9.0 SDK** (current version)
- Visual Studio 2022 17.12+ / VS Code / JetBrains Rider 2024.3+

**Note**: .NET 9 is a Short Term Support (STS) release. For production applications, consider using .NET 8 (LTS) which is supported until November 2026.

### Clone and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivek-baliyan/clean-architecture-performance.git
cd clean-architecture-performance

# Build and test
dotnet build
dotnet test tests/Unit                                    # Fast tests (~2ms)
dotnet test tests/BadExamples                             # Slow tests (~847ms)

# Benchmarks and validation
dotnet run --project benchmarks --configuration Release  # Performance comparison
dotnet test tests/Unit --filter "ArchitectureTests"      # Architecture validation
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```

## 🔍 The 5 Mistakes

### 1. Folder Illusion
**Problem**: Interfaces in wrong layer  
**Fix**: Put interfaces where consumed, not implemented  
**Evidence**: [Architecture Tests](tests/Unit/UserTests.cs#L173-L208)

### 2. Testing Trap  
**Problem**: Unit tests with database dependencies  
**Fix**: True unit tests (pure domain logic)  
**Result**: 847ms → 2ms (42,350% faster) *with real SQL Server*  
**Examples**: [Bad Integration Tests](src/CleanArchitecture.Examples/Mistake2_TestingTrap/Bad/) vs [Good Unit Tests](src/CleanArchitecture.Examples/Mistake2_TestingTrap/Good/)  
**Note**: Current in-memory tests run in ~566ms (still 28x slower than true unit tests)

### 3. Too Many Layers
**Problem**: 4-layer mapping overhead  
**Fix**: Direct projection Entity → ViewModel  
**Result**: 847μs → 312μs (65% faster)

### 4. Cargo Cult Culture
**Problem**: Over-engineering (47 files for email)  
**Fix**: Pragmatic design (1 class)  
**Result**: 3.5hr → 5min delivery

### 5. Interface Overload
**Problem**: Interface for everything  
**Fix**: Strategic abstractions only  
**Result**: 47 → 2 interfaces (96% fewer)

## 🧪 Validation

```bash
# Architecture validation
dotnet test tests/Unit --filter "ArchitectureTests"
# Note: PowerShell audit script needs syntax fixes (see issues)

# Performance benchmarks & profiling
dotnet run --project benchmarks --configuration Release
# For detailed profiling analysis: use PerfView, dotMemory, or BenchmarkDotNet on real workloads
```
