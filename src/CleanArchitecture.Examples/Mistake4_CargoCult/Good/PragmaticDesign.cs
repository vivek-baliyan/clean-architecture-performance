/// <summary>
/// Evolution Timeline - How this service grew organically:
/// 
/// Day 1: Just EmailService.SendEmailAsync() - 3 lines, shipped in 5 minutes
/// Week 2: Added SendHtmlEmailAsync() when marketing needed HTML emails  
/// Month 3: Added IEmailService when testing became painful
/// Month 6: Added EmailConfiguration when we deployed to staging
/// Month 8: Added EmailServiceFactory when we added SendGrid support
/// 
/// Each addition was driven by real needs, not "just in case"
/// Total planning time: 0 minutes (decisions made while coding)
/// Architecture discussions: 0 (let the code speak)
/// </summary>

/// <summary>
/// Key Principles Applied:
/// 
/// 1. ✅ Start simple, evolve as needed
/// 2. ✅ No interfaces until you swap implementations
/// 3. ✅ No patterns until you feel the pain they solve
/// 4. ✅ No configuration until you have multiple environments
/// 5. ✅ No abstractions until you have multiple concrete implementations
/// 6. ✅ Make decisions in code, not meetings
/// 7. ✅ YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - until you do
/// 
/// When to use this approach:
/// - Small to medium teams
/// - Rapid prototyping
/// - MVP development
/// - When requirements are unclear
/// - When delivery speed matters
/// 
/// When NOT to use:
/// - Large, distributed teams (need coordination)
/// - Well-understood, complex domains
/// - Regulatory/compliance requirements
/// - When you've built the same thing 10 times before
/// </summary>

/// <summary>
/// Comparison with Cargo Cult Approach:
/// 
/// ❌ BAD (Cargo Cult):
/// - 30-minute planning session
/// - 47 lines of code
/// - 20+ DI registrations
/// - 15+ interfaces
/// - 3.5 hours to deliver
/// - Complex testing (20+ mocks)
/// 
/// ✅ GOOD (Pragmatic):
/// - 0 planning time
/// - 3 lines of code
/// - 1 class registration
/// - 0 interfaces (initially)
/// - 5 minutes to deliver
/// - Simple testing (no mocks needed)
/// 
/// Delivery Speed Improvement: 4,200% faster (5 minutes vs 3.5 hours)
/// Code Complexity Reduction: 93% less code (3 lines vs 47 lines)
/// Cognitive Load Reduction: 100% less ceremony

        // No need for 20+ mocks like the cargo cult version

/// <summary>
/// When to Evolve (Decision Tree):
/// 
/// Need multiple email providers? → Add interface
/// Need complex configuration? → Add configuration class
/// Need to test without sending emails? → Add interface + mock
/// Need retry logic? → Add it when emails start failing
/// Need templates? → Add them when you have duplicate content
/// Need metrics? → Add them when you need to monitor
/// 
/// Rule: Add complexity when you feel the pain, not before
